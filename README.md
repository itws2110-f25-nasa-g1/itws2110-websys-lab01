# ITWS2110 WebSys Group1 Lab1 Part1

Part 1: Group portfolio
You must create a landing page that highlights the work of your team. It is ok if you make up a list of previous works, awards won, etc. Be realistic though. You probably didn’t win that Nobel Prize...

This landing page, named index.html (styled with style.css), should include at a minimum...\
●	Team name\
●	Team slogan\
●	Team logo, if you have a graphics designer among you\
●	List of at least 3 previous works (you can make this up)\
●	Include a description and one tiny mock-up for each previous work (Or, even easier, if you still have your projects from Intro, take a screenshot of the main page and scale it down to a thumbnail and you’re done)\
●	Photo of each group member\
●	Links to each individual member page

Remember: this page should be free advertising for your team. Make it catchy. Make people want to hire your group. Everyone contributes to this page. You need this page anyway for your term projects, so good to do it now.
