# ITWS2110 WebSys (Group 1) Lab 1, Part 1: Group Portfolio

### General Group Progress
- Made basic html skeleton with header and 2 horizontal boxes for our projects and people sections respectively
  - https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp
  - Implemented horizontal box containers using flexbox CSS
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow
  - also added containers which allow their children to overflow and enable scroll

- Added some of our previous projects to the page, along with bullet point descriptions

- Met as a group to come up with name, slogan, logo and finish up site:
  - each member added their own image and a link to their resume page (part 2)

- Made sure to use semantic tags like header, section, and h tags
  - used div instead for most of the special CSS containers implemented (e.g. for horizontal containers and scrolling)

- Established readable file structure for ease of future use
  - understandable folder stacking makes for clean and accessible resources
 
### Personal Reflections

- Keira
  - This assignment was a good exercise of my ITWS-1100 muscles I didn't exercise over the summer. It was a good re-acclimation to the web development workflow.
  - Some issues I hit along the way were HTML validation -- I always forget you can't put linebreaks within a list! -- and getting my local GitHub environment set up with our repo. These were both issues that were good to hit now to refresh my HTML memory, test my development environment, and make sure my workflow was at a good starting point for this semester.
  - I referenced some outside sources throughout this assignment. These were [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/atrule_font-face.php) for implementing a local font on the site, and my own work on [WRPI.org](https://wrpi.org) and my personal site for ITWS-1100 (private repo, site not up). 
- Carli
  - Creating this basic site and linking in the resumes that we each worked on was a good way to practice what was learned last semester and get back into the swing of things.
  - I ran into a few validation issues but was able to get those cleared up (using divs in uls, etc.)
  - Working together makes it very easy for each of us to check each other and make suggestions on how to make the overall site better, as well as what to do for the sake of uniformity.
