# ITWS2110 WebSys (Group 1) Lab 1, Part 1: Group Portfolio

### General Group Progress
- Made basic html skeleton with header and 2 horizontal boxes for our projects and people sections respectively
  - https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp
  - Implemented horizontal box containers using flexbox CSS
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow
  - also added containers which allow their children to overflow and enable scroll

- Added some of our previous projects to the page, along with bullet point descriptions

- Met as a group to come up with name, slogan, logo and finish up site:
  - each member added their own image and a link to their resume page (part 2)

- Made sure to use semantic tags like header, section, and h tags
  - used div instead for most of the special CSS containers implemented (e.g. for horizontal containers and scrolling)
